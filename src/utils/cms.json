    "who": "If you hear voices, HVN can help- we are committed to helping people who hear voices. We offer information, support and understanding to people who hear voices and those who support them.",
    "what": "The project is about collecting first person accounts of voice hearing. You can write, tag and submit your own experience, and you can read about other experiences. It's all anonymous.",
    "why": "Most research about hearing voices is done by people who don't hear voices, about people who do. We want to change this. We want people who hear voices to be able to use their own words to describe their experience, and to categorise it themselves. We want research that reflects the immense diversity in voice hearing. We also want to create research that voices hearers find useful, and can access. These are some of the ideas behind this project.",

We are particularly keen to hear from people who have had ongoing health issues or a disability long before Covid-19 happened. If you sign up you’ll be able to share up to 700 words of writing. You can write about whatever Covid-19 experiences matter most to you, for instance: loneliness; looking after someone else or yourself; how you engage with health or care services; how you buy food; and what you do to stay connected to people. We are not looking for the most dramatic, heart breaking or inspiring stuff. We want to know what it’s really like to live with ill health or disability or support someone who does during this period. <p>There is no obligation to give your name. You can submit a single experience, or multiple ones over a period of time.</p> ",
